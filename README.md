# Project 7 OpenClassrooms - Develop a search algorithm in JavaScript

The purpose of the project is to build a working prototype of a website that allows users to search for recipes through a search engine.

- The first mission is to implement the search functionality. 
- The second mission is to optimize the algorithm so that to get a fast, almost instantaneous search!

## Technical constraints

- For each algorithm, make two different implementations to compare their performances and choose the best one. 
- No library allowed. 
- Code should pass the W3C validator.

## Tips for starting the algorithm part
- First step: plan the 2 versions of the functionality you want to test. Since you are going to deal with a lot of arrays, it would be interesting to make a version using the native loops (while, for...) and a functional programming version with array object (foreach, filter, map, reduce). 
- Second step: implement them both. For that, use 2 different branches on Git so that we keep the code separate for each one. 
- The third and last step: to choose the best algorithm, test their performance. Use the performance comparison tool such as [![JSben.ch](https://img.shields.io/badge/jsben-jsben.ch-yellow)](https://jsben.ch/). It will give you the number of operations per second performed by each script and thus allow you to see which script is the most efficient. 
- Both implementations should focus only on the main search field.
- Use draw.io to make the schemas, it's very convenient and free.
